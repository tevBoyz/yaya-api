# Yaya API Middleware

A secure middleware API that acts as a shield between your frontend applications and the Yaya Wallet API, handling authentication and request signing automatically.

## Deployment

The project is deployed and accessible online:

**Frontend** (React App) ‚Üí Vercel: https://yaya-frontend-pi.vercel.app/

**Backend** (NestJS API) ‚Üí Render: https://yaya-api-fc5p.onrender.com

Both services are live and integrated.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Both deployments use free-tier hosting.

- The backend (Render) may go into sleep mode after inactivity and can take 20‚Äì60 seconds to spin back up on the first request.

- This can cause some initial delay when testing the endpoints through the frontend or API directly.

**If you want to run it locally follow the instructions below.**

## Purpose

This API middleware serves as a security layer to protect your Yaya Wallet API credentials. Instead of calling the Yaya API directly from frontend code (which would expose your API key and secret), all requests are routed through this middleware which:

- Securely stores API credentials in environment variables
- Automatically generates required HMAC signatures for each request
- Adds proper authentication headers
- Acts as a proxy between your frontend and the Yaya API

## Assumptions

- Current User context:
  User identity is inferred through API creds set in .env (YAYA_API_KEY, YAYA_API_SECRET). No Login and auth implemented.
- Environment:
  Middleware is assumed to run in a secure server enviroment. Secrets should never be revealed on the client side.
- API Behaviour:
  pagination begins at ?p=1 handled server side
  API may retunr empty array when no records are found.
- This is a sanbox model

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Automatically signs requests with keyed-HMAC signatures
- **Environment Protection**: Keeps API credentials secure on the server side
- **Header Management**: Handles all required authentication headers automatically
- **Easy Integration**: Provides simple endpoints that mirror the Yaya API
- **CORS Enabled**: Ready to be consumed by frontend applications
  ```CORS
      app.enableCors({
        origin: [
          'http://localhost:5173'
        ],
        credentials: false,
        methods: [ 'GET','POST' ]
        });
  ```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Yaya Wallet API credentials (API Key and Secret)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tevBoyz/yaya-api.git
cd yaya-api
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
YAYA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
YAYA_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
YAYA_BASE_URL=https://sandbox.yayawallet.com
```

4. Start the server:

For development with auto-restart:

```bash
npm run start:dev

# Server runs on http://localhost:3000

# At this point you can use the frontend repo to clone and start the dashboard to view results
# Dashboard repo: https://github.com/tevBoyz/yaya-frontend

# Alternatively, use Postman to test responses using the endpoints below
```

## API Endpoints

### Get Server Time

```http
GET http://localhost:3000/time
```

### Get User Transactions

```http
GET http://localhost:3000/transactions/find-by-user

# With pagination:
GET http://localhost:3000/transactions/find-by-user?p=1
# Returns the first page of transactions
```

### Search Transactions

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/transactions/search
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "Your_search_parameter"
}
```

## How It Works

This middleware automatically handles the Yaya API authentication requirements:

1. **Timestamp**: Generates a current timestamp for each request (no authentication headers required for the time endpoint)
2. **Signature**: Creates an HMAC signature using your API secret

   ```signature formula
     const timestamp= Date.now();
     const method = 'GET";
     const endpoint = 'api/en/transactions/function'
     const body = '';
     const pre = timestamp + method + endpoint + body;
     const signature = crypto.create("sha256", api_secret).update(pre).digest('base64);

    # for more info refer to the manual provided by YAYA: https://docs.yayawallet.com/hc/main/articles/1699693758-api-authentication
   ```

3. **Headers**: Adds the required headers to each request:
   - `YAYA_API_KEY`: Your Yaya API key
   - `YAYA_API_TIMESTAMP`: The current timestamp
   - `YAYA_API_SIGN`: The generated HMAC signature

## Testing

This project includes two layers of automated tests:

### Unit Tests

Located under src/utils/signature.spec.ts.
Verifies correctness of the signature generation utility.
Ensures signatures are consistently generated using the expected algorithm.

```
# Run unit tests with:
npm run test

```

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

Located under test/app.e2e-spec.ts.
Spin up the NestJS application in memory (no separate server process required).
Validate full API behavior, including:

1. GET /time ‚Üí returns server time.

2. GET /transactions/find-by-user?p=1 ‚Üí returns a paginated list of transactions.

3. POST /transactions/search ‚Üí returns filtered transactions based on the search query.
   ```
   { "query": "surafel" }
   ```
   The test ensures:
   ‚úÖ Status code 200 is returned.
   ‚úÖ Response contains a data array.
   ‚úÖ If transactions exist, at least one record matches the search keyword.

```
# Run e2e tests with:
npm run test:e2e
```

## Rememeber

üëâ Unit test require environment variables from .env. Make sure your .env is configured before running.

üëâ E2E tests boot the app using AppModule, so no manual npm run start is needed.

```
# You can run both unit and e2e tests together with:

npm run test -- --watchAll
```

## Built With

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) - API framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed JavaScript
- [Crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) - Node.js built-in crypto module for HMAC generation
- [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) - Environment variable management

## Important Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file or expose your API credentials
- Ensure your server environment is secure
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Regularly rotate your API keys for enhanced security

## Support
